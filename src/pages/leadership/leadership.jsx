        Leading with Vision: Empowering Teams and Inspiring Change
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Leadership is not defined by a title, but by action, influence, and
        impact. True leadership goes beyond managing tasks—it’s about inspiring
        people, building trust, and creating a shared vision that motivates
        everyone to move forward together.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        1. Leadership Is Influence, Not Authority
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Great leaders understand that their real power lies in their ability to
        inspire and influence others, not in commanding them. They listen
        actively, communicate clearly, and lead by example. When people feel
        heard and valued, they are more likely to follow willingly and
        contribute their best.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        2. Vision with Purpose
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A strong leader has a clear vision and communicates it with purpose.
        Whether it's guiding a team project or driving a long-term mission,
        leaders help others see the bigger picture. They turn goals into shared
        dreams, aligning everyone’s efforts toward a common direction.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        3. Building Teams, Not Just Task Lists
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Leadership is about building people. A successful leader knows how to
        unite individuals with different strengths and create an environment
        where collaboration thrives. They encourage learning, celebrate small
        wins, and help others grow—because when the team grows, everyone wins.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        4. Decision-Making with Empathy and Courage
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Good decisions come from a balance of data and empathy. A great leader
        remains calm under pressure, makes informed choices, and has the courage
        to stand by them. At the same time, they remain open to feedback and
        adapt when needed, showing humility and wisdom.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        5. Creating a Culture of Trust
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Trust is the foundation of all successful leadership. Leaders who are
        honest, transparent, and accountable earn the respect of their team.
        When people feel safe, respected, and empowered, they take initiative,
        speak up, and innovate without fear.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Leadership is a journey of learning, service, and growth. Whether you’re
        leading a student organization, managing a business, or guiding a small
        project, the principles remain the same: serve others, stay authentic,
        and lead with heart.
